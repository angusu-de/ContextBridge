ContextBridge turns the AI resources you already have into one controlled pool.

Once a machine, runtime or model API joins the pool, it stops being another one-off integration. Your apps can send work to CB and either let it choose a compatible resource or tell it exactly what may be used.

At the simple end, you just prompt the pool. At the other end, you can constrain providers, models, worker groups, hardware requirements, egress, cost and other execution details.

```text
website / app / CLI / MCP
          |
          |  "do this"
          v
    ContextBridge
          |
          +-- gaming PC
          +-- old workstation
          +-- laptop
          +-- VPS
          +-- Ollama
          +-- llama.cpp
          +-- model API
          +-- adapter
```

**No, this is not an Ollama wrapper with a WebSocket attached.**

Ollama is one possible resource. So is llama.cpp. So is an OpenAI-compatible model API. Machines are resources too. If a useful new runtime, router or API appears tomorrow, CB should not need to replace it. Ideally, it becomes another capability in the pool.

The relay authenticates and queues jobs, applies configured policy, filters incompatible workers and ranks the remaining resources using current capacity and capability evidence. It records what actually handled the work. Workers connect outbound, so the machines doing the work do not need public inbound ports.

## Weird shit works.

CB is developed against a deliberately messy setup, not a clean two-node demo that has never seen a router reboot.

My development pool has included a gaming PC, three older workstations, a TERRA mini PC, a Samsung laptop, Kali and Ubuntu systems, multiple Linux VPSes, local model runtimes and remote model APIs.

Several ordinary shared-hosting sites, with no GPU and no useful local AI compute of their own, already submit work into the same pool over HTTPS.

I test the annoying parts too: Wi-Fi disappearing at the router instead of a polite process shutdown, real connection loss and reconnects, partial and complete outages, malformed provider responses and mixed CB versions during development.

The point is not to pretend distributed systems never fail. It is to know **where** they failed and avoid making things worse by guessing. An uncertain post-dispatch state is not silently replayed just because retrying would look prettier in a demo.

| Your setup | What CB adds |
| --- | --- |
| Website on shared hosting, model on your PC | The site submits a job over HTTPS; the worker connects outbound and does the work elsewhere. |
| A random collection of PCs, servers and laptops | They become one capability-aware pool instead of separate integrations. |
| Local models plus remote model APIs | Both can sit behind the same job boundary. |
| Multiple apps sharing the same resources | Each app gets its own scoped producer credential instead of a shared admin secret. |
| You just want something done | Send the task and let CB choose a compatible resource. |
| You care exactly where and how it runs | Add provider, model, group, hardware, egress, cost and other supported requirements. |

Connect **Ollama**, managed **llama.cpp**, **OpenAI-compatible model APIs** and optional external adapters.

No ContextBridge cloud account is required for self-hosting.

## Get running

Install ContextBridge first, then choose what this device should do. A relay or
sender needs no GPU, local model, or Ollama installation.

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IamAngusU/ContextBridge/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Linux / macOS

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IamAngusU/ContextBridge/main/install.sh | sh
```

The installer starts with four plain-language outcomes:

```text
Create a new pool      coordinate other devices
Join an existing pool  contribute this device's resources
Use an existing pool   send work only
Use only this device   keep execution local
```

Choose **Use ContextBridge only on this device** for the shortest single-PC
path. Choose **Create a new pool** when this machine should coordinate other
devices; CB then asks separately whether it should also run work. Execution
resources such as Ollama or managed llama.cpp are requested only for devices
that will actually execute jobs. You can change participation later; joining a
different pool needs approval, and moving pool authority is a separate
protected operation.

For **Join an existing pool**, choose either a trusted LAN join bundle for a
private LAN/VLAN/VPN path or the pool owner's HTTPS relay URL. A join bundle
pins the exact relay identity; CB never treats discovery or a private IP as
trust.

The installer downloads the latest release, verifies its published checksum,
and creates a private configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> This README tracks current `main`, while the install commands above deliberately download the latest published release. Until the next release catches up, newer main-only commands such as `cluster estimate`, `cluster lan relocate`, and `pair --interactive` require a build from current source. Release/onboarding parity is tracked in #36.

To run the first real model request, have Ollama running with at least one
installed text-generation model, or select the managed-runtime path during
installation. Open a **new terminal**. If the installer did not start the
service, run `contextbridge run` and leave that terminal open. In another
terminal:

```sh
contextbridge doctor
contextbridge cluster chat --provider ollama --model auto --artifacts off --prompt "Reply exactly with CB-OK"
```

Your local relay queues the request, your worker runs a compatible installed model, and the answer returns to the terminal. `auto` selects an available compatible model, not a promised quality tier.

Commands use the installer-created configuration automatically. For a custom installation, append `--config /path/to/config.yml`. Read [install.ps1](install.ps1) / [install.sh](install.sh) before executing them, or use the [release archives](https://github.com/IamAngusU/ContextBridge/releases/latest).

To change what an installed device does without memorizing role flags, run
`contextbridge guide` in a real terminal. It asks for the intended outcome, derives
safe existing/default values, requests only unresolved connection data, shows a
redacted provenance summary, and saves nothing until you confirm. Scripts, CI,
MCP and redirected input never prompt; use deterministic `cluster configure`
flags there. See [Guided CLI setup](docs/guided-setup.md).

If you cloned the repository or used GitHub's **Code -> Download ZIP**, run the
checked-out installer directly:

```powershell
# Windows, from the extracted repository directory
.\install.ps1
```

```sh
# Linux/macOS, from the extracted repository directory
sh ./install.sh
```

Those scripts still install the latest checksummed release binary; a source
ZIP is not itself a platform binary and is not an offline installer. For an
offline/manual installation, download the matching platform archive and
`SHA256SUMS` from [Releases](https://github.com/IamAngusU/ContextBridge/releases/latest).

### Connect an app without reading YAML

If an app accepts an OpenAI-compatible base URL, let CB generate a private,
ready-to-load environment file:

```sh
contextbridge integrate openai --write-env .contextbridge.env
```

Point the app at that file, or run `contextbridge integrate openai` to see the
non-secret settings. Existing files are never overwritten and the token is
hidden unless you explicitly request `--show-token`. For an MCP client:

```sh
contextbridge integrate mcp --json
```

Before opening the app, `contextbridge integrate openai --check` verifies the
service, local credential and selected route without inference. Add `--live`
only when you intentionally want one bounded real model request.

Already use LiteLLM? Keep it. ContextBridge does not depend on it, but can
generate a secret-free model entry plus a separate private environment file:

```sh
contextbridge integrate litellm --write-config ./litellm-contextbridge.yaml --write-env ./.contextbridge-litellm.env
```

This optional layering exposes CB as one LiteLLM model named `contextbridge`;
direct CB clients continue to work unchanged. See the
[LiteLLM example and authority boundaries](examples/litellm/README.md).

Copy the emitted server entry into the client's MCP configuration. See
[Application integrations](docs/integrations.md) for the native job API, PHP,
shared hosting and security boundaries. A remote website uses its own scoped
producer token; do not expose the local service token to browser JavaScript.
Create that credential directly on the relay without printing its secret:

```sh
contextbridge integrate relay --subject my-server-app --max-jobs-per-hour 120 --max-queued-jobs 8 --write-env ./contextbridge-producer.env
```

The [minimal Python and Node.js examples](examples/server-app/README.md) use
only their standard runtimes and demonstrate durable submit, bounded polling
and terminal-result handling.

For a custom dashboard, desktop client, website backend, or terminal UI,
create a separate read-only observer credential and use the reusable
dependency-free JavaScript client:

```sh
contextbridge integrate ui --subject my-dashboard --write-env ./contextbridge-ui.env
node examples/server-app/javascript-observe.mjs
```

It exposes versioned pool, node, job, pipeline, timing, capability and event
data without granting submit/cancel authority. Keep its token in the trusted
backend or desktop secret store, never in a public browser bundle.

> [!TIP]
> Trying CB does not lock you in. `contextbridge uninstall --dry-run` previews removal without stopping or deleting anything. [Uninstall keeps your configuration and data by default.](#uninstall)

## Connect your devices

A **relay** coordinates the pool. A **worker** runs the job. An **application token** lets another client submit work. Workers connect outbound; they need no public inbound ports.

Once a job is assigned, `contextbridge cluster estimate JOB_ID` can show a
clearly labelled, non-authoritative p50–p90 range learned from this pool's own
bounded successful history. It shows `unavailable` instead of inventing an ETA
when comparable evidence is sparse, stale, disabled, or already exceeded.

No VPS, public DNS or Internet connection is required for a pool that stays on
one private LAN. Initialize a relay-owned TLS identity, transfer the public
join bundle through a trusted local channel, and join the worker:

```sh
# relay machine
contextbridge cluster lan init

# worker machine
contextbridge cluster lan join --bundle ./contextbridge-lan-join.json --name home-pc
```

The bundle pins the relay certificate; CB does not weaken the boundary to
cleartext private-network HTTP. See [Secure offline LAN pools](docs/offline-lan.md)
for approval, firewall, air-gap and WAN-loss behavior. If the relay later gets
a new private IP or local DNS name, `contextbridge cluster lan relocate`
creates a same-key relocation bundle; workers accept it only after the live
new endpoint proves the identity they already pinned.

<details>
<summary><strong>Set up a relay, pair another machine and issue an app token</strong></summary>

### 1. Choose the coordination host

Install CB on your server. Replace `https://relay.example.net` below with your relay's real HTTPS address. Set up an HTTPS reverse proxy with WebSocket support to `127.0.0.1:32150`; the commands below do not create DNS, certificates or the proxy.

Stop an existing managed instance before changing roles (`contextbridge stop`; use its service manager if applicable), then configure and start the relay:

```sh
contextbridge cluster configure --mode relay --listen 127.0.0.1:32150 --public-url https://relay.example.net
contextbridge run
```

Keep the local service on loopback. Only expose the relay through HTTPS. A coordination-only host needs no model or GPU. [Deployment and operations](docs/operations.md).

### 2. Join each compute device

Install CB on the device with your models. If it is already running, stop it before changing roles. Then:

```sh
contextbridge cluster configure --mode worker --relay-url https://relay.example.net --name home-pc
contextbridge pair
```

Pairing prints a code and waits. In a **second terminal on the relay host**, inspect pending requests and approve the matching code:

If the device has not been fully configured yet, use
`contextbridge pair --interactive`; it asks only for the unresolved safe
values and shows a redacted confirmation before contacting the relay.

```sh
contextbridge cluster pairing
contextbridge cluster pairing --approve PAIRING-CODE
```

Replace `PAIRING-CODE` with the code shown on that device. After approval, run `contextbridge run` on the worker. Its identity is saved locally; you do not copy the relay admin token to it. Repeat with a distinct name for each device.

For a one-line Windows worker install, PowerShell must invoke the downloaded
text as a script block so the options reach the installer (options appended to
`iex` itself do not):

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IamAngusU/ContextBridge/main/install.ps1'))) `
  -Provider ollama `
  -RelayUrl 'https://relay.example.net' `
  -NodeName 'home-pc'
```

The supplied relay URL infers worker mode. `NodeName` is optional and defaults
to the operating-system hostname. The equivalent unattended Linux/macOS
installation is:

```sh
tmp="$(mktemp)"
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IamAngusU/ContextBridge/main/install.sh -o "$tmp"
CONTEXTBRIDGE_NONINTERACTIVE=1 \
CONTEXTBRIDGE_PROVIDER=ollama \
CONTEXTBRIDGE_RELAY_URL=https://relay.example.net \
CONTEXTBRIDGE_WORKER_NAME=home-pc \
sh "$tmp"
rm -f "$tmp"
```

Both commands still stop at the short-lived pairing approval. Supplying a
relay URL removes redundant setup questions; it does not bypass trust.

On the relay host, check the pool and send a job:

```sh
contextbridge cluster status
contextbridge cluster chat --provider ollama --model auto --artifacts off --prompt "Which tasks can you help with?"
```

### 3. Give an application its own token

On the running relay host, using its private configuration:

```sh
contextbridge cluster token create --role producer --subject my-app --max-jobs-per-hour 120 --max-queued-jobs 8
```

This prints token JSON. Store it securely; **never give an application the relay admin token**. The optional limits are stored with the credential and enforced durably by the relay. `--providers ollama --egress local_only` can additionally prevent that credential from selecting a remote route. For a separate CLI client, save the returned JSON as a private **UTF-8** file named `producer-token.json` and transfer it through a secure channel. Do not commit it.

`tenant_id` is a caller-selected namespace and policy selector, not customer
authentication. For a customer- or project-specific token, add
`--allowed-tenants customer-42`; a single value is applied when omitted and a
different value fails before policy selection. Multiple comma-separated
values require the client to choose one exact allowed value. See
[Producer identity and tenant labels](docs/tenancy.md).

For an application that must never submit cleartext payloads, issue a separate
credential with `--require-e2ee`. The relay then rejects cleartext admission
with `privacy.e2ee_required`; a forgotten client flag cannot silently weaken
that credential. This is payload confidentiality, not relay anonymity or a
zero-knowledge claim. Use the credential only with clients that implement CB's
one-time encrypted assignment flow.

List credential metadata or revoke a known token ID without exposing secrets:

```sh
contextbridge cluster token list
contextbridge cluster token revoke tok_0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
```

On that client, install CB in **client/sender** mode, then point it at the relay and load the credential:

```sh
contextbridge cluster configure --mode client --relay-url https://relay.example.net
contextbridge cluster login --token-file ./producer-token.json
contextbridge cluster chat --provider ollama --model auto --artifacts off --prompt "Reply exactly with POOL-OK"
```

The client submits work without joining as a worker. Login stores the token in its private config; remove the temporary token file when no longer needed. Use `--role observer` when issuing a read-only monitoring credential.

### 4. Change a device's role later

Roles are reversible. Stop the managed process before changing the role so a
previous worker cannot keep accepting assignments with an old in-memory
configuration. To retain the CLI/API as a sender but stop contributing local
execution capacity:

```sh
contextbridge stop
contextbridge cluster configure --mode client --relay-url https://relay.example.net
contextbridge run
```

`sender` is accepted as an alias for `client`. The saved worker identity stays
on that device, but the restarted service does not send worker heartbeats or
accept assignments. A sender also needs its own scoped producer credential as
shown in step 3.

To contribute the device again:

```sh
contextbridge stop
contextbridge cluster configure --mode worker --relay-url https://relay.example.net --name home-pc
contextbridge doctor
contextbridge run
```

When the saved identity still belongs to that relay, no new pairing is needed.
If `doctor` reports a missing or incompatible worker identity, run
`contextbridge pair` and approve the new code on the relay. Switching to
`local` disables the relay and worker services while keeping the local bridge
available; revoke or remove a saved producer credential separately when the
device must also lose permission to submit remote work.

For your own app, use the producer token with the [native job API or PHP client](docs/integrations.md). The local OpenAI-compatible API uses the **local service token**, not the relay producer token. [Pool and placement details](docs/pools-and-placement.md).

</details>


## Just prompt the pool

Once a client has a producer credential, you do not need to build a job file just to use the pool:

```sh
contextbridge cluster chat --provider ollama --model auto --artifacts off --prompt "Summarize this in three bullets: ..."
```

The answer comes back to the same terminal. For the shortest round-trip check:

```console
$ contextbridge cluster chat --provider ollama --model auto --artifacts off --prompt "Reply exactly with CB-OK"
  → requested: ollama · model auto
ai  › CB-OK
  ↳ used: ollama · qwen2.5:latest
  ✓ 1.8s · <worker-id>
```

The `ai ›` line is the model answer. ContextBridge then shows execution metadata so you can see what actually handled the job. The selected model, worker ID and timing depend on your pool.

Prefer one live surface? Run `contextbridge console`. With a configured scoped
producer credential, its bounded command row can `send TEXT`, list `jobs`, open
an owned `job`/`result`, and request `cancel`; without that credential it stays
read-only. It is never a host shell, never inherits relay-admin authority merely
because it runs beside the relay, and piped input cannot turn it into a mutation
surface. While you type, it shows the effective character and relay-payload
limits, highlights incomplete/invalid values, and offers only compatible next
flags and live provider/model choices. See
[operations](docs/operations.md#observe-diagnose-and-stop).

Attach one or several local images when the selected worker/model supports vision:

```sh
contextbridge cluster chat --provider ollama --model auto --attach-image ./photo.jpg --artifacts off --prompt "Describe what is visible. Do not guess unreadable text."
```

Repeat `--attach-image` up to 12 times for comparison or OCR batches. PNG,
JPEG, WebP and GIF are accepted; all input images share an 8 MiB decoded
budget. The job carries the exact count, aggregate bytes and media types as
routing requirements. A worker whose verified model passport cannot satisfy a
known hard limit is not eligible; an unknown limit is shown as unknown, never
invented as zero.

```sh
contextbridge cluster chat --provider ollama --model auto --attach-image ./before.png --attach-image ./after.png --artifacts off --prompt "List only the visible differences."
```

You can also put hard requirements on the request. For example, if your relay policy classifies Ollama as local and your workers advertise a `private` group:

```sh
contextbridge cluster chat --provider ollama --group private --egress local_only --e2ee --artifacts off --prompt "Summarize this private note: ..."
```

`--group private` restricts placement to workers in that group. `--e2ee` encrypts prompt and result payloads between the producer and the reserved worker; the relay still sees coordination metadata. `--egress local_only` is an enforced boundary only when execution policy is enabled and the provider is correctly classified. Worker owners can separately restrict allowed tasks, providers, models, and concurrency. For supported remote providers, `--max-cost-usd` can request a hard cost ceiling; unverifiable pricing fails closed when that ceiling is required.

Operators can make E2EE mandatory for one producer credential with
`cluster token create --require-e2ee` or `integrate relay --require-e2ee`.
See the exact [privacy boundary and visibility matrix](docs/privacy.md).

A path or URL inside prompt text does not give ContextBridge permission to read or fetch it. See the [pool input and control examples](examples/pool/README.md) for text/JSON jobs, application uploads, policy setup, and artifact handling.

</details>

## Send work from your app

**Shared hosting works too:** your server-side PHP application posts a job to the relay and retrieves the result later. The [PHP client](examples/php/ContextBridgeClient.php) needs PHP 8.1+, cURL and outbound HTTPS, not a CB process, shell access or a GPU on the web host. The relay and workers run elsewhere.

This is a real pool request. Save it as `job.json` ([example file](examples/pool/text-job.json)):

```json
{
  "contract_version": "contextbridge.job.v1",
  "source": "my-web-app",
  "requirements": { "task": "generation", "provider": "ollama" },
  "payload": {
    "provider": "ollama",
    "prompt": "Summarize the supplied text in two sentences.",
    "text": "Delivery moved to Friday. Notify support.",
    "output": { "mode": "text", "max_bytes": 4096 }
  },
  "max_attempts": 1
}
```

From a configured CLI client, preview admission and then submit:

```sh
contextbridge cluster contract validate --file ./job.json --json
contextbridge cluster submit --file ./job.json
```

### Get the answer back

Application code does not parse terminal output. The durable flow is:

```text
submit -> job ID -> worker runs -> completed -> result.output.text
```

For a completed text job, the relevant part of the JSON result looks like this:

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "result": {
    "output": {
      "mode": "text",
      "text": "Delivery moved to Friday. Notify support."
    }
  }
}
```

So in any language that can send and read JSON, the answer is simply `result.output.text`. The native relay API accepts the job at `POST /v1/cluster/jobs?compact=1`; fetch it later with `GET /v1/cluster/jobs/JOB_ID?compact=1`.

The included PHP client makes the same flow small. For a CLI script, worker, or other process where waiting is acceptable:

```php
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/ContextBridgeClient.php';

$relay = getenv('CONTEXTBRIDGE_RELAY_URL') ?: '';
$token = getenv('CONTEXTBRIDGE_PRODUCER_TOKEN') ?: '';
$client = new \ContextBridge\ContextBridgeClient($relay, $token);

$request = json_decode(
    file_get_contents(__DIR__ . '/job.json'),
    true,
    64,
    JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR,
);

// Use one stable, persisted idempotency key for one logical operation.
$accepted = $client->submit($request, 'order-123-summary');
$job = $client->wait($accepted['id']);

echo $job['result']['output']['text'] ?? '';
```

For a normal web request, do not keep PHP open waiting for the model. Persist the returned job ID, then read it in a later authenticated request or cron/worker:

```php
$accepted = $client->submit($request, $operationId);
$jobId = $accepted['id']; // persist this

// Later:
$job = $client->job($jobId);
if (($job['status'] ?? '') === 'completed') {
    $answer = $job['result']['output']['text'] ?? null;
}
```

Handle `failed` and `cancelled` separately. Text output can also report `truncated: true` when it reaches the requested byte limit. See the [complete PHP example](examples/pool/README.md#3-submit-from-php-shared-hosting) for production-oriented error handling, polling and idempotency.

**Your job, your constraints:** choose a provider/model, worker group, JSON keys or output size. Egress and cost limits require enabled operator policy and supported enforcement; a prompt cannot grant extra permissions. Text files can supply text, one supported image can be attached, and capable adapters can return files. There is no generic `files[]` upload field.

[PHP submission, polling, text/JSON examples and file boundaries](examples/pool/README.md) · [Operator and per-job controls](examples/pool/README.md#4-choose-what-a-job-may-use-and-return). The PHP example uses HTTPS, not E2EE; keep producer tokens server-side.

## Measured overhead

**Coordination, not inference.** Dated development measurements from **20 September 2026**, with 128 samples after 8 warmups and one concurrent client:

| Operation | Windows p50 / p99 | Linux VPS p50 / p99 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Durable submit → read → cancel | 2.402 / 3.740 ms | 12.165 / 36.304 ms |
| Small E2EE job + result | 0.098 / 0.193 ms | 0.217 / 0.496 ms |
| Verify a 64 KiB artifact | 0.065 / 0.134 ms | 0.141 / 0.446 ms |

Queue throughput: **418.5 ops/s** on the Windows i9-12900K; **73.8 ops/s** on the shared two-vCPU Linux VPS. Sampled idle benchmark-process + relay RSS: **14.4 / 12.7 MiB**, respectively. No models were running in these measurements.

These are different machines, not an OS comparison or an SLA. Model execution and cross-device network latency are excluded; shared-VPS contention was uncontrolled.

## Uninstall

**Preview first. Nothing is stopped or removed:**

```sh
contextbridge uninstall --dry-run
```

Then remove the installer-owned program and integrations, keeping configuration and managed data:

```sh
contextbridge uninstall
```

Acts on **this machine only**, not the whole pool. Active work blocks removal unless explicitly overridden. To deliberately remove locally managed data as well, review [the separate `--purge` option and preserved paths](docs/operations.md#remove-contextbridge-safely). No purge or force flag is needed for an ordinary uninstall.

## Open by design. Precise about trust.

Self-hosting is fully functional. CB coordinates existing runtimes; it does not pool VRAM or split a model itself. Optional or credential-required E2EE protects job payloads, **not coordination metadata**. Configurable policies are not all enabled by default. Ambiguous execution is not silently retried.

Releases include checksums, SBOMs and third-party notices; AGPL releases also publish corresponding source. Build records are explicitly unsigned.
